    "In this notebook, we successfully completed the **web scraping, cleaning, transformation, and preparation** of historical cryptocurrency data (top 10 coins weekly) from CoinMarketCap spanning **2013 to 2025 (7th December)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key accomplishments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**\n",
    "   - Scraped weekly cryptocurrency data including: `Date`, `Name`, `Symbol`, `Market Cap`, `Price`, `Circulating Supply`, `Volume (24hr)`, and percentage changes (`% 1h`, `% 24h`, `% 7d`).\n",
    "   - Ensured extraction of top-performing coins for each week and consistent structure for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning & Formatting**\n",
    "   - Converted string values to appropriate numeric formats.\n",
    "   - Removed symbols like `$`, `,`, `%`, `<`, `>`, and handled placeholders like `--`.\n",
    "   - Parsed dates from URL-style strings to `datetime` objects.\n",
    "   - Applied consistent float formatting for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing Value Imputation**\n",
    "   - Identified missing values, primarily in the `Volume (24hr)` column.\n",
    "   - Applied **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation** after normalizing numerical columns.\n",
    "   - Successfully filled missing values and reversed normalization to retain original scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Type Transformation**\n",
    "   - All numeric columns (`Market Cap`, `Price`, `Circulating Supply`, `Volume (24hr)`, `% 1h`, `% 24h`, `% 7d`) were converted to `float64`.\n",
    "   - `Date` column is in `datetime64[ns]` format.\n",
    "   - Data is now fully structured and ready for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Export**\n",
    "   - Saved the fully cleaned and transformed dataset as `historical_crypto_sundays.csv` for further use in **Power BI, SQL databases, or other analytical tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome:**  \n",
    "The dataset is now complete, accurate, and formatted for **visual analytics, trend analysis, and interactive dashboards**. This forms a solid foundation for creating professional cryptocurrency market insights and investment dashboards.\n",
